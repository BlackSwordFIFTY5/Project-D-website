            <p><b>Gunma Prefecture</b></p>
            <p>Gunma Prefecture, located in the mountainous Kanto region, is renowned not only for its breathtaking natural landscapes but also as a hotbed for street racing. The rural, winding roads that cut through the mountains are famous among racers for their challenging curves, steep climbs, and sharp hairpin turns—making the region an iconic destination for both experienced drivers and adrenaline seekers.</p>
            <p>The most famous of these racing routes is Akina, a mountain pass that has earned its reputation as one of the most difficult tracks in the region. Known for its sharp corners and narrow roads, Akina is a proving ground where only the most skilled drivers can thrive. Other famous passes such as Irohazaka and Usui offer similarly intense challenges, with racers navigating treacherous conditions to maintain their speed and control.</p>
            <p>For years, Gunma’s roads have been the stage for fierce rivalries between racing teams. From the street-smart local drivers to the well-organized racing teams that travel from all over the country, the region sees a constant flow of high-speed battles. Whether it’s the tight-knit Akina Speed Stars or the more aggressive teams that call the highlands their home, the area has become synonymous with both thrilling victories and crushing defeats.</p>
            <p>Beyond the races, the local car culture is deeply embedded in the lives of its residents. Car tuning shops, tire dealers, and performance garages line the streets, each offering services to fine-tune machines for the next race. It’s a culture of innovation and craftsmanship, where the pursuit of speed and precision in driving is just as much a way of life as it is a sport.</p>
            <p>Gunma Prefecture’s mountain roads remain a sacred space for those who live for the rush of racing, with the picturesque views and challenging terrain standing as the perfect backdrop for the legends of the road. For racers, the prefecture is not just a location—it’s where skills are honed, rivalries are forged, and the road to victory begins.</p>

            <p id="akina-section"><b>Mount Akina</b></p>
            <img src="Images/akina-track.jpg" alt="Akina Track">
            <p>Mount Akina (秋名山 Akina-san) is a mountain located in Takasaki, Gunma Prefecture. The course is famous for it's five consecutive hairpins.</p>
            <p>Akina is the home course of the Akina SpeedStars, as well as Bunta and Takumi Fujiwara. Bunta was the fastest driver on Akina for many years, but is no longer active as a street racer and most locals are unaware of him. The deliveries for his tofu business travel through the pass, and he used this to train his son Takumi as a racer. After his racing debut, Takumi became known as "Akina's Eight-Six" and was considered to be the fastest racer on Akina, eventually setting the downhill course record in an untimed run.</p>
            <p>Mount Akina is based on Mount Haruna (榛名山 Haruna-san), a dormant stratovolcano in Takasaki, Gunma. Along with Myogi and Akagi, it is one of the "Three Mountains of Jōmō" (上毛三山). Akina Pass is a section of the Jomo-Sanzan Panorama Highway on the north-eastern side of the mountain, which falls within the borders of Shibukawa. In the live action film the Yahikoyama Sky Line in Niigata is used to represent Akina.</p>
            <p>Rising majestically in Gunma Prefecture, Mount Akina is more than just a natural landmark—it's the beating heart of the region's street racing culture. Known for its winding, treacherous mountain pass, Akina has become a revered and feared destination for racers seeking to prove their skill and endurance.

This famous peak is ranked among Japan's three most noted places of rugged beauty. There are many hiking courses, and when the foliage changes color there are splendid views to be seen.</p>
            <p>Mount Myōgi, along with Mount Akagi and Mount Haruna, is one of the "Three Mountains of Jōmō". (Jōmō is an old name for Gunma.)</p>
            <p>Mount Myōgi is the home course of the racing team called the Myogi NightKids.</p>
            <p>One weakness for drivers on Myogi is that it is a more straight course so cars like the Suzuki Cappuccino and the Mazda MX-5 will fall behind (if not modified/modded lightly)</p>
            <p>Nestled in the rugged terrain of Gunma Prefecture, Mount Myogi stands as one of the most revered and challenging racing destinations in the region. Known for its stunning rock formations and winding mountain roads, Myogi offers a unique blend of natural beauty and high-stakes racing challenges.

Drivers must navigate its twists with the utmost control, as the steep drops and unpredictable road conditions leave no room for error. Every corner demands a calculated approach, and the slightest misjudgment can send a car careening off the edge or into the unforgiving mountain terrain.</p>
            <p>The climb up Myogi’s roads is particularly punishing, with the road often narrowing as it winds through dense forests and rocky cliffs. Fog and mist are common, adding to the challenge and reducing visibility, which only heightens the intensity of the race. As drivers approach the higher altitudes of the mountain, the air thins, and the road steepens, demanding even more from both the car and the driver. For the experienced racer, this is a place to demonstrate not just speed, but the ability to handle extreme conditions with confidence.</p>
            <p>Myogi’s reputation has made it a sought-after location for rivalries between street racing teams.
